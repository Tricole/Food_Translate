# Food_Translate

A nutrition application that provides feedback to the user on whether the food item meets their dietary requirements

This is done using google's vision & translation APIs that convert photos into text. This is then processed against dietary restrictions (eg: nut allergy) specified by the user to find out if it can be eaten or not
